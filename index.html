            <p>dDef is a decentralized security layer built on Solana, aiming to protect against attacks on the Solana network. The system analyzes incoming transactions according to the algorithm and cancels the transaction if it is malicious, allowing it to continue if it is not. This project placed 2nd and won an award at the<strong></strong>2024 Solana Hackathon. <a href="https://github.com/tukideniz/dDef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Link</a></p>

            </div>
            <p>Developed a Restricted Area Management System to manage and visualize predefined restricted zones on a map. Users can view, create, edit, and delete restricted areas efficiently. Spatial data is stored in a structured format and the application provides real-time interaction with the map. Backend is built with Node.js and Express.js; spatial storage uses PostgreSQL with PostGIS; polygons render on the frontend using Leaflet.js. The app communicates via a RESTful API for seamless data retrieval and manipulation. I implemented custom loading indicators, optimized database queries, and ensured smooth user interactions. Tools: Postman (API testing) and Git (version control).</p>
